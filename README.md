# PythonChallange
This is my attempt to solve the puzzel that is on http://www.pythonchallenge.com/


Level 0:
 The level 0 has me do 2^38 which is as python tell me 274877906944
 put that in url i get www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/274877906944.html
 
 which redirects to : www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/map.html
 
 Level 1:
  The level 1 has one pic nothing else
  which reads
  K -->M
  O -->Q
  E --> G
  
  so basically this seems simple cryptography and here each of the latter is 2 step ahead so
  I.E. A becomes C
  
  so
  well i think this is the level where coding begames
